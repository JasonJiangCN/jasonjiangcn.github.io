# Intro

This is the conclusion made for the internship during the summer break of 2017 at Shandong Jianzhu University, or SDJZU. 



The base project is rewrite the front-end part of the management system of the university, which originally made with jQuery EasyUI ,with a new JavaScript framework. 



This is the first time I take part in a real webapp project. Get experience for the front-end development, also some back-end and database abilities. During the whole project I got tons of questions and problems, and I sovled all of them finally. 

# Project Pages

The front-end part is written with Vue.js.

Plugins and Tools used: Vue.js + Vue-router + Axios + Element UI + Webpack

All soure code can be found at https://github.com/JasonJiangCN/executiveManager

# Framework Decision

The EasyUI, which used by the old version of management system is out-of-date. It is slow, having no concepts like module. So the source code can be extremely long and unable to reuse at all. 



This time I compared three the most popular framework, and here is my conclusion.

## Vue.js (My Final Decision)

- It is super light-weight and super fast
- perfect documentation, in both English and Chinese
- Various third-part components
- Great modularization. Every components are save as a ".vue" file.
- Great support for Single Page Applications, SPAs

## React.js

- Hold by Facebook
- JSX: mix up html and javascript, powerful but hard to use for new developers.
- built natively for iOS and Android

## Angular.js

- Hold by Google
- Super powerful, built-in router, not friendly for new developers
- mainstream framework right now
